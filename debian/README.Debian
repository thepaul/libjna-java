jna for Debian
--------------

According to the current Debian policy for java [1], all jvm should
include /usr/lib/jni in their default library search path. Apparently
this is not the case; if libjnidispatch.so is not found when calling
jna, please add "-Djava.library.path=/usr/lib/jni" to your java
invocation.
