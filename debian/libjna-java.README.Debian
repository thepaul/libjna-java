libjna-java for Debian
----------------------

According to the current Debian policy for java [1], all jvm should include
/usr/lib/jni in their default library search path. Apparently this is not the
case; if libjnidispatch.so is not found when calling jna, please add
"-Djava.library.path=/usr/lib/jni" to your java invocation.
